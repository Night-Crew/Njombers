# Nj√∏mbers

A Discord bot that enforces the rules for counting natural numbers:

## Rules:

We must restart the count IF:

- [x] The wrong number is posted.
- [ ] A message is edited/deleted since that chain started.
- [x] Any person posts with fewer than 5 unique people posting before them. This carries over restarts.
- [x] No foreign languages or posts deemed 'not clear by the other members. The exact number must be clearly visible fully!
- [x] The post must start with the number. Main number cannot be spelt out.
- [x] Any other characters must be clearly separated from the main number with a space!
- [x] You are not allowed to spell out the number by using emojis.

## Tips:

- The only way to guarantee a successful post is to copy the formatting of previous posts. Don't risk doing something different!
- Scroll down or press the Esc key before you post!
- Don't use mobile with bad signal!

## Moderation:

- [x] Intentional trolling will result in a mute.
- [ ] 3 MISTAKES AFTER THE COUNT HAS PASSED 10, AND YOU ARE MUTED! 3 STRIKES = OUT!
- [ ] Each time the count hits 666, everybody will have 1 strike removed from their name.
- [ ] When the count beats the record, all the strikes will be reset.
- [ ] When strikes are removed, people that were previously muted for having 3 strikes will be unmuted until they hit 3 strikes again.
